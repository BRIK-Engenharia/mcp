\title{Fit Multiple Linear Segments And Their Change Points}
\usage{
mcp(segments, data = NULL, prior = list(), family = "gaussian",
  par_x = NULL, sample = TRUE, jags_explicit = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A list of formulas - one for each segment. The right-hand
side specifices the form of intercepts and slopes. For the first segment,
the left-hand side is the response variable. In the following segments, the
left-hand side is the change point (on x). See examples for more details.}

\item{data}{Data.frame or tibble in long format.}

\item{prior}{Named list. Names are parameter names (cp_i, int_i, [x_var]_i,
  sigma) and the values are either

   * A JAGS distribution (e.g., \code{int_1 = "dnorm(0, 1) T(0,)"}) indicating a
     conventional prior distribution. Uninformative priors based on data
     propertiesare used where priors are not specified. This ensures good
     parameter estimations, but it is a questionable for hypothesis testing.
     \code{mcp} uses SD (not precision) for dnorm, dt, dlogis, etc. See
     details. Change points are forced to be ordered through the priors using
     truncation, except for uniform priors where the lower bound should be
     greater than the previous change point, \code{dunif(cp_1, MAXX)}.
   * A numerical value (e.g., \code{int_1 = -2.1}) indicating a fixed value.
   * A model parameter name (e.g., \code{int_2 = "int_1"}), indicating that this parameter is shared -
     typically between segments. If two varying effects are shared this way,
     they will need to have the same grouping variable.}

\item{family}{WORK IN PROGRESS. One of "gauss" (default), "binomial"}

\item{par_x}{String (default: NULL). Only relevant if no segments contains
slope (no hint at what x is). Set this, e.g., par_x = "time".}

\item{sample}{Boolean (default: TRUE). Set to FALSE if you only want to check
priors, the JAGS model, etc.}

\item{jags_explicit}{Pass JAGS code to \code{mcp} to use directly. Useful if
you want to make small tweaks, but mostly used for the development of mcp.}

\item{...}{Parameters for \code{jags.parfit} which channels them to \code{jags.fit}.}
}
\value{
An \code{mcpfit} object.
}
\description{
Given a list of linear segments, \code{mcp} infers the posterior
distributions of the parameters of each segment as well as the change points
between segments. All segments must regress on the same x-axis. Change points
are forced to be ordered using truncation of the priors. You can run
\code{fit = mcp(segments, sample=FALSE)} to avoid sampling and the need for
data if you just want to get the priors (\code{fit$prior}), the JAGS code
\code{fit$jags_code}, or the R function to simulate data (\code{fit$func_y}).
}
\details{
Noites on priors:
  * Order restriction is automatically applied to cp_\* parameters using
    truncation (e.g., T(cp_1, )) so that they are in the correct order on the
    x-axis UNLESS you do it yourself. The one exception is for dunif
    distributions where you have to do it as above.
  * In addition to the model parameters, \code{MINX} (minimum x-value), \code{MAXX}
    (maximum x-value), \code{SDX} (etc...), \code{MINY}, \code{MAXY}, and \code{SDY}
    are also available when you set priors. They are used to set uninformative
    default priors.
  * Use SD when you specify priors for dt, dlogis, etc. JAGS uses precision
    but \code{mcp} converts to precision under the hood via the sd_to_prec()
    function. So you will see SDs in \code{fit$prior} but precision ($1/SD^2)
    in \code{fit$jags_code}

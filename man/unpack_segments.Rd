\usage{
unpack_segments(segments, prior = list(), param_x = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A list of formulas - one for each segment. The right-hand
side specifices the form of intercepts and slopes. For the first segment,
the left-hand side is the response variable. In the following segments, the
left-hand side is the change point (on x). See examples for more details.}

\item{prior}{Named list. Names are parameter names (cp_i, int_i, [x_var]_i,
sigma) and the values are the associated priors in JAGS code. Uninformative
default priors are used where priors are not specified. The parameter can
be fixed to a numerical value by setting it as such (\code{int_1 = 7.3}).
\code{mcp} uses SD (not precision) for dnorm, dt, dlogis, etc. See details.
Change points are forced to be ordered through the priors using truncation,
\code{dnorm(0, 1) T(cp_1, )}, except for uniform priors where the lower
bound should be greater than the previous change point, \code{dunif(cp_1, )}.}

\item{param_x}{String (default: NULL). Only relevant if no segments contains
slope (no hint at what x is). Set this, e.g., param_x = "time".}
}
\value{
A list with prior (list), formula_jags (string), func_y (function),
  param_x (string), param_y(string).

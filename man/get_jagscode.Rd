\usage{
get_jagscode(prior, ST, formula_str, family)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior}{Named list. Names are parameter names (cp_i, int_i, [x_var]_i,
sigma) and the values are either
\itemize{
  \item A JAGS distribution (e.g., \code{int_1 = "dnorm(0, 1) T(0,)"}) indicating a
    conventional prior distribution. Uninformative priors based on data
    properties are used where priors are not specified. This ensures good
    parameter estimations, but it is a questionable for hypothesis testing.
    \code{mcp} uses SD (not precision) for dnorm, dt, dlogis, etc. See
    details. Change points are forced to be ordered through the priors using
    truncation, except for uniform priors where the lower bound should be
    greater than the previous change point, \code{dunif(cp_1, MAXX)}.
  \item A numerical value (e.g., \code{int_1 = -2.1}) indicating a fixed value.
  \item A model parameter name (e.g., \code{int_2 = "int_1"}), indicating that this parameter is shared -
    typically between segments. If two varying effects are shared this way,
    they will need to have the same grouping variable.
}}

\item{ST}{Segment table. Returned by \code{get_segment_table()}.}

\item{formula_str}{String. The formula string returned by \code{build_formula_str}.}

\item{family}{One of \code{gaussian()}, \code{binomial()}, \code{bernoulli()}, or \code{poission()}.
Only default link functions are currently supported.}
}
\value{
String. A JAGS model.
